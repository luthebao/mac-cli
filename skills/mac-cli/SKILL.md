name: mac-cli
description: Drive the `mac-cli` binary on Apple Silicon macOS to clean disk junk, take screenshots, and optimise/convert/downscale/strip-EXIF images and videos. Use this skill whenever the user asks to free up disk space, clear caches/logs, uninstall a Mac app cleanly, flush DNS, thin Time Machine snapshots, screenshot a specific running app, compress or convert a media file (png/jpg/gif/mp4/mov), strip image metadata, or anything that sounds like "shrink this video", "make this png smaller", "clean my Mac", "screenshot Slack" — even when they don't name `mac-cli` directly. Apple Silicon (arm64) only.

# mac-cli

`mac-cli` is a single-binary macOS utility with three workhorse subcommands plus a self-updater:

| Subcommand | What it does |
|---|---|
| `clean`  | Disk cleaner — caches, logs, Trash, Downloads, dev caches, duplicates, plus app uninstall and maintenance tasks |
| `clop`   | Media pipeline — optimise / downscale / convert / strip EXIF on images and videos |
| `shot`   | Screenshot — full screen or a single running GUI app by PID |
| `update` | Self-update from GitHub Releases |

The binary lives at `mac-cli` on `$PATH` once installed. Apple Silicon only — refuse to run this on Intel Macs.

## Before doing anything

Confirm the binary is installed and on `$PATH`:

```bash
command -v mac-cli && mac-cli version
```

If absent, the install one-liner is `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luthebao/mac-cli/main/install.sh | bash`. Don't run installers without the user's say-so.

When in doubt about a flag, run `mac-cli help <subcommand>` — it's the authoritative reference and may be ahead of this skill.

## The interactive-vs-flagged rule (read this first)

`mac-cli` is friendly to humans: `mac-cli clean` and `mac-cli shot` with no args both open a TUI picker. **Those modes will hang under an agent because there is no TTY to drive.** Always reach for the flagged form.

Rules of thumb:

- `clean` → use a subcommand (`categories`, `maintenance --dns`, `uninstall --dry-run`, `backup --list`, `config --show`) rather than bare `clean`.
- `shot` → use `-s` (full screen), `-l` (list with PIDs), or `-p <pid>` (specific app). Never bare `shot`.
- `clop` → already flag-driven, but on first use of a format it may prompt to `brew install` a missing tool; in non-interactive contexts it declines silently and the operation fails. Verify required tools exist before invoking on a large batch (see `clop` § below).

If the user explicitly wants the interactive UX (they're sitting at the terminal and asked for it), tell them the exact command to type — don't try to drive it yourself.

## `clean` — disk cleaner

### The category taxonomy is a safety boundary

`mac-cli clean categories` groups categories into three buckets — **treat these as a hard guardrail**:

- 🟢 **Safe** — Trash, temp files, browser cache, Homebrew cache, Docker. Fine to clean without ceremony.
- 🟡 **Moderate** — system caches, system logs, dev caches (npm/yarn/pip/DerivedData/CocoaPods), orphaned node_modules, orphaned launch agents. Apps may need to rebuild state; logs help debugging.
- 🔴 **Risky** — old Downloads, iOS backups, Mail attachments, language files, large files, duplicates. Real data lives here. **Never** include risky categories unless the user has explicitly named one of them or said "include risky" / "clean everything".

The `--risky` flag is what unlocks 🔴 categories. Treat it like `rm -rf` — opt-in, narrated, and never your default.

### Cleaning paths

The bare interactive picker is unusable for agents. Use these instead:

```bash
mac-cli clean categories                 # list all 16 (safe to run anytime — pure inspection)
mac-cli clean config --show              # show effective config (paths, excludes, age thresholds)
mac-cli clean config --init              # write default config to ~/.mac-cli/clean/config.json
mac-cli clean maintenance --dns          # flush DNS (uses sudo — will prompt for password)
mac-cli clean maintenance --purgeable    # thin Time Machine local snapshots
mac-cli clean maintenance --timemachine  # list + delete TM local snapshots
mac-cli clean backup --list              # list pre-delete backups (clean creates these automatically)
mac-cli clean backup --clean             # delete backup sessions older than 7 days
```

For uninstalling a Mac app and its leftovers:

```bash
mac-cli clean uninstall --dry-run        # ALWAYS start here — shows what would go
mac-cli clean uninstall --yes            # skip confirmation prompts (after you've verified)
```

Run `--dry-run` first, show the user the list, get explicit confirmation, then run with `--yes`. Uninstall is destructive and crosses into shared system state.

### What about cleaning specific categories non-interactively?

The bare `mac-cli clean` is the only path that picks categories, and it requires a TTY. If the user wants a one-shot cleanup of specific 🟢 buckets without the picker, tell them to either (a) run it interactively themselves, or (b) edit `~/.mac-cli/clean/config.json` (see `clean config --show` for the schema) to disable categories they don't want, then run interactively. Don't try to script around the picker.

## `clop` — image & video pipeline

`clop` is flag-driven and agent-friendly. It picks an operation, optionally a modifier, and a path. If the path is a directory, every supported file inside is processed; add `-r` to recurse.

### Operations (pick exactly one)

| Flag | Operation | Backed by |
|---|---|---|
| `-o`, `--optimise` | Re-encode in place, same format | pngquant / jpegoptim / gifsicle / ffmpeg |
| `-d <factor>`, `--downscale <factor>` | Resize by factor (`0.5` or `50%`) | vipsthumbnail (images) / `ffmpeg -vf scale` (videos) |
| `-c <fmt>`, `--convert <fmt>` | Convert to `webp`, `heic`, or `avif` | cwebp / heif-enc |
| `-s`, `--stripexif` | Strip EXIF, keep orientation | exiftool |

### Modifiers

- `-a`, `--aggressive` — stronger compression, **visible** quality loss. Don't add this by default; only when the user asks for "smallest possible" or accepts quality loss.
- `-r`, `--recursive` — recurse into subdirectories when the path is a directory.
- `-k`, `--keep` — save `<file>.orig` next to each modified file. Use this whenever you're operating on user-supplied originals you can't easily re-fetch.

### Supported extensions

Images: `.png .jpg .jpeg .gif`. Videos: `.mp4 .mov .m4v`. PDFs are currently skipped.

### Tool prerequisites

`clop` shells out. If the tool for a chosen operation is missing, in an interactive context it offers to `brew install` it; in a non-interactive context it declines and fails. Before a large batch, check:

```bash
brew list pngquant jpegoptim gifsicle ffmpeg vips webp libheif exiftool 2>&1 | tail -20
```

The full install command if anything's missing:

```bash
brew install pngquant jpegoptim gifsicle ffmpeg vips webp libheif exiftool
```

### Example invocations

```bash
mac-cli clop -o ~/Pictures/screenshot.png             # single file, in place
mac-cli clop -o ~/Pictures -r                         # whole tree, all supported types
mac-cli clop -d 50% ~/Videos/clip.mp4                 # downscale a video
mac-cli clop -c webp ~/Pictures/cover.png             # convert to webp
mac-cli clop -s ~/Phone/IMG_2156.jpg                  # strip EXIF
mac-cli clop -o -k ~/Pictures/cover.png               # optimise, keep .orig backup
```

### Safety habits

- For destructive-ish operations (`-o`, `-c`, `-s`) on user originals, add `-k` unless the user said not to.
- For `-c`, the original file isn't deleted — a new file with the target extension is written alongside. Confirm with `ls` after running if the user expects in-place replacement.
- Don't combine `-o` with `-a` silently; aggressive mode is a quality decision the user should make.

## `shot` — screenshot

Saves PNGs to `~/Desktop`. First invocation on a fresh macOS install will prompt for **Screen Recording** permission in System Settings → Privacy & Security; if it fails silently, that's the cause — tell the user to grant it and retry.

```bash
mac-cli shot -s                # capture the whole screen
mac-cli shot -l                # list running GUI apps: PID  Name
mac-cli shot -p 1234           # capture the app with PID 1234
```

To screenshot "Slack" or "Safari" by name, do it in two steps:

```bash
mac-cli shot -l | grep -i slack         # find the PID
mac-cli shot -p <pid>                   # capture
```

Don't run bare `mac-cli shot` — it opens an interactive filter picker that will hang.

---

## `update` — self-update

```bash
mac-cli update                 # install latest release if newer
mac-cli update --check         # report-only; exits non-zero if an update is available
mac-cli update --force         # reinstall even if already current
```

Environment overrides: `PREFIX=<dir>` to pick an install dir, `VERSION=x.y.z` to pin a specific release.

`update --check` is the safe inspection variant; bare `update` actually downloads and replaces the binary, so confirm with the user before running it unless they explicitly asked to update.

---

## Failure modes worth recognising

- **"command not found: mac-cli"** → not installed, or installed under `~/.local/bin` which isn't on `$PATH`. Check `ls ~/.local/bin/mac-cli` and PATH.
- **A `clop` invocation reports a missing tool** → the corresponding brew formula isn't installed; install it and retry (see the toolchain list above).
- **`shot` produces no file** → Screen Recording permission not granted. Walk the user to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording.
- **`clean maintenance --dns` fails** → needs `sudo`; if the user is in a non-interactive shell with no sudoers entry, surface that clearly rather than retrying.
- **Hangs forever with no output** → almost always an interactive prompt waiting on a TTY. Kill the process, switch to the flagged form.

## Things this skill does *not* do

- Run on Intel Macs (the binary is `darwin-arm64` only).
- Process PDFs through `clop` (planned, currently skipped).
- Drive the interactive TUIs of `clean` or `shot`. Use flags, or hand the command back to the user to run.
